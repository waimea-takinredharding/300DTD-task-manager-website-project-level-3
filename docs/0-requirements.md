# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My family (end-users) often end up using paper lists to keep track of tasks and needed purchases. The paper can be misplaced, or people can forget to put certain items on the list, meaning things can be forgotten.

There is a need for a simple system that lets users put in tasks, select people to do them, and then mark them as complete.

## End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.
The end-users will be my family. They have some level of tech experience


## Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

# Relevant Implications

## End-users

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

### Relevance to the System

This project is focused on a small set of specific end users, so focusing on the specific needs of these end users is important.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.



## Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

### Relevance to the System

Functionality is relevant to this particular project because if the website is not functional, then the most basic point of the project is not being fulfilled, and is therefore useless.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.



## Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

### Relevance to the System

Usability is relevant to this particular project because if the website is not usable, then it will be frustrating or inconvenient to use, which will go against the goal of being more convenient and usable than paper lists.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.



## Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

### Relevance to the System

Aesthetics are important to this project because it is focused on a small group of end users who will be seeing and using it consistently, so nailing down the design to be appealing is highly important.

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.



## Accessibility

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

Accessibility is important for this project because it is likely to be used in public settings, meaning things like glare and lighting issues in general could make it harder to see the contents of the project

### Impact / Considerations

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.
